          <p>I was only three years old when I drew my first elephant. It all started when I asked my mom if she could draw one for me. Everything was going well, until she showed me her work. I started to cry, as any toddler would when they find out that their role model isn't the best at everything. After consoling me, she suggested I give it a try and that's when I found my passion in life.</p>
          <p>As a designer, I want to tell a story through my motion graphics and illustration work, as well as inspire others to try.</p>

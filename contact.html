      <p>When I was 3 years old, I drew my first elephant. It all started when I asked my mom if she could draw one for me. Everything was going as planned, until it wasn't. After showing me her work, I started to cry. she suggested I give it a try and that's when I found my passion in life.</p>
      <p>As a designer, I want to tell a story through my motion graphics and illustration work, as well as inspire others to try.</p>

When I was 5 years old, I drew my first elephant. It all started when I asked my mom if she could draw one for me. Everything was going as planned, until she showed me her work. I started to cry so she handed me the pencil and that's when I discovered my passion in life.

As a designer, I want to tell a story through my work and inspire others to try. Shoot me an email at jennifer@sommerfeldesigns.ca!

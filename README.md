When I was about 3 years old, I asked my mom if she could draw me an elephant. When she showed me her work, I started to cry so she suggested I try drawing one and I did... and it was better! That day, I discovered my passion for art.

As a designer, I believe that everyone is creative but my goal is to inspire people through my motion graphics and illustration work.

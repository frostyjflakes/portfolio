        <p class="gutter-2 wrapper">When I was 3 years old, I drew my first elephant. It all started when I asked my mom if she could draw one for me. Everything was going as planned, until she showed me her work. I started to cry so she handed me the pencil and that's when I discovered my passion in life.</p>
        <p class="gutter-2 wrapper">As a designer, I want to tell a story through my motion graphics and illustration work, as well as inspire others to try. Shoot me an email at <u>jennifer@sommerfeldesigns.ca</u>!</p>

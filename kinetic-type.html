<h1 class="text-center yotta pad-t">Kinetic Type</h1>
<p class="gutter">The Kinetic Type assignment was one of the first project where I learnt to apply null objects and experimented with camera settings, in order to attain the angles, I designed and communicate an action using only lyrics and some basic transform tools. The audio I chose for my project is the song Sax by Fleur East because I was inspired by the colour palette and the effects from the music video.</p>
